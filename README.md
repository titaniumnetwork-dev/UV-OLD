# Installation and Setup

Installation of Ultraviolet is simple. You can find a Tl;DR of the installation and setup process just below. If you are unfamiliar with the "standard" installation process, look a bit farther down for a more comprehensive installation and setup guide.

## Basic Guide

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-Node --recursive
$ cd Ultraviolet-Node
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Replit Setup Guide

To setup on Replit, first click on the "Run on Replit" button. After loading into your repl, run the following commands:
```sh
$ npm install
$ chmod +x main.sh
$ ./main.sh
```

You will only have to run the second command once. It just allows `main.sh` to be executed. By running `main.sh`, you will update any submodules and will start the app.

**Note**: If you choose not to use `main.sh`, but would rather just run all commands manually, please note that you will have to manually install submodules by running `git update submodules --init`. Without it, `static` will not be installed, and that is a required directory.

## Comprehensive Guide

Below will describe a comprehensive guide to install Ultraviolet on Linux machines.

To clone the repository, simply run the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-Node --recursive
```

The `--recursive` flag will clone the repository and all submodules.

To begin work on the actual setup, cd into the repository. You can do so by running the following command:

```sh
$ cd Ultraviolet-Node
```

From here, you can update your submodules and install your dependencies. To do so, run the following command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Finally, to start Ultraviolet, run the following command:

```sh
$ npm start
```

You can then find Ultraviolet on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. If you would like to change the port UV will be running on, edit the last line in `index.mjs`. 

Please note that UV will not function without HTTPS. If you are hosting on Replit or Heroku, this won't be a problem as they provide you with SSL/TLS by default and will automatically apply it to your instance, however if you are attempting to host UV on a different platform, such as a personal server, you **WILL** need to use HTTPS. 

## Configuration
Configuring Ultraviolet is very simple. Simple descriptions of each configurable option are provided as a comment in the block below. More detailed documentation can be found just below mentioned block.

`uv.config.js`

```javascript
self.__uv$config = {
    prefix: '/sw/', // Proxy url prefix
    bare: '/bare/', // Bare server location
    encodeUrl: Ultraviolet.codec.xor.encode, // URL Encoding function
    decodeUrl: Ultraviolet.codec.xor.decode, // Decode URL function
    handler: '/uv.handler.js', // Handler script
    bundle: '/uv.bundle.js', // Bundled script
    config: '/uv.config.js', // Configuration script
    sw: '/uv.sw.js', // Service Worker Script
};
```

| Configuration | Options and Explanation |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prefix | The prefix is the prefix that you want users to see. Ex: `https://example.com/service.` The default prefix is `service`. |
| Bare | Bare Servers can run on directories. For example, if the directory was /bare/ then the bare origin would look like `http://example.org/bare/`. The bare origin is passed to clients. |
| encodeUrl| EncodeUrl is how you want the URL a proxy site's visitors has to be encoded. Options include `Ultraviolet.codec.base64.encode`, `Ultraviolet.codec.plain.encode`, or `Ultraviolet.codec.xor.encode`. It is recommended that you use `xor` or `base64` as it hides the queries your visitors are searching and visiting.
| decodeURL | DecodeUrl is how you want the url to be decoded. It is recommended you keep it the same as `encodeUrl`. |
| Handler | Handler is the path to the UV handler. The default name and path to this file is `static/uv/uv.handler.js`. |
| Bundle | Bundle is the path to the UV bundle file. The default name and path to this file is `static/uv/uv.bundle.js`. |
| Config | Config is the path to the UV config file. The default name and path to this file is `static/uv/uv.bundle.js`. |
| SW | SW is the path to the UV Service Worker script. The default name and path to this file is `static/uv/uv.sw.js`. |

## Static Files

Static files is the frontend for Ultraviolet. A standalone repository for it can be found [here](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-Static).

## Nginx configuration

```nginx
location / {
	proxy_busy_buffers_size  512k;
	proxy_buffers  4 512k;
	proxy_buffer_size  256k;
 	proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
	proxy_http_version 1.1;
	proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	proxy_set_header Connection 'Upgrade';
    	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:$server_port;
    	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	proxy_set_header Host $host;
}

```

## Core Scripts

[Configuration](#configuration) mentions a few scripts that make up Ultraviolet. To get documentation for what each of the scripts do, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-Core) for them in their standalone repository.
